   unordered numbers.  Many FPUs provide special instructions to support
   these operations.  Generic support in GCC for these as builtins went
   in before 3.0.0, but not all cpus added their patterns.  We define
   versions that use the builtins here, and &lt;bits/mathinline.h&gt; will
   undef/redefine as appropriate for the specific GCC version in use.  */</doc>
