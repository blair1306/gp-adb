    Accoding to Douglas Gwyn &lt;gwyn@arl.mil&gt;:
	&quot;This spec was changed in ISO/IEC 9899:1999 TC1; in ISO/IEC
	9899:1999 as initially published, the expansion was required
	to be an integer constant of precisely matching type, which
	is impossible to accomplish for the shorter types on most
	platforms, because C99 provides no standard way to designate
	an integer constant with width less than that of type int.
	TC1 changed this to require just an integer constant
	*expression* with *promoted* type.&quot;

	The trick used here is from Clive D W Feather.
