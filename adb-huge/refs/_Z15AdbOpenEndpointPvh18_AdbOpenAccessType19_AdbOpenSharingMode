  Endpoints are always opened for overlapped I/O.
  @param[in] adb_interface A handle to interface object created with 
         AdbCreateInterface call.
  @param[in] endpoint_index Zero-based endpoint index. There are two
         shortcuts for this parameter: ADB_QUERY_BULK_WRITE_ENDPOINT_INDEX
         and ADB_QUERY_BULK_READ_ENDPOINT_INDEX that provide information
         about bulk write and bulk read endpoints respectively.
  @param[in] access_type Desired access type. In the current implementation
         this parameter has no effect on the way endpoint is opened. It&apos;s
         always read / write access.
  @param[in] sharing_mode Desired share mode. In the current implementation
         this parameter has no effect on the way endpoint is opened. It&apos;s
         always shared for read / write.
  @return Handle to the opened endpoint object or NULL on failure. If NULL is
          returned GetLastError() provides extended error information.
